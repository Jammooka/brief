Brief is a light plugin that allows you to notify a certain user group when
new entries are added to a section.

## Features

This module is in active development. You're free to use this on your sites, and
are encouraged to open an issue if you find that something's not working as it
should.

## Additions
- Email Modification
- ~~Settings page~~
- ~~Section/Single/Structure Selection~~
- ~~User Group Selection~~

## Usage

1. Install the plugin by putting the `brief` directory in your `craft/plugins`
folder.
2. Go to the plugin settings and select which section you'd like Brief to watch.
3. Select the User Group you'd like to notify about any new entries.
4. Click 'Save'. You're done!

Any users in your selected group will now recieve email notifications when a new
entry is added to your section. If you add new users to that group, Brief will
add them to the notification list automatically; you don't need to do anything
 else.
