Brief is an extremely light plugin that allows you to notify certain users when
new entries are added to a section.

## Features

to play around with it you can manually change the settings in the plugin files.

## Additions
- Settings page
- Section/Single/Structure Selection
- User Group Selection
- Email Modification

## Usage

1. Install the plugin by putting the `brief` directory in your `craft/plugins`
folder.
2. This project is in beta. There are currently no front-end settings. To modify
the plugin, change the `init()` function in `BriefPlugin.php` as needed.
